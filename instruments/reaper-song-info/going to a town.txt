But I don't know where I'm going
Searching for that place
It's not inside me
I wonder where I'll go
Don't we always linger
'Cause we know this ain't had no good
I'm going to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm going to a place that has already been disgraced
I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down
I'm so tired of America
I'm gonna make it up for all of The Sunday Times
I'm gonna make it up for all of the nursery rhymes
They never really seem to want to tell the truth
I'm so tired of you, America
Making my own way home
Ain't gonna be alone
I've got a life to lead, America
I've got a life to lead
Tell me, do you really think you go to hell for having loved?
Tell me, enough of thinking everything that you've done is good
I really need to know
After soaking the body of Jesus Christ in blood
I'm so tired of America
I really need to know
I may just never see you again, or might as well
You took advantage of a world that loved you well
I'm going to a town that has already been burnt down
I'm so tired of you, America
making my own way home
Ain't gonna be alone
I've got a life to lead, America
I'm making my own way home
Ain't gonna be alone
I've got a life to lead, America
I'm making my own way home
Ain't gonna be alone
I've got a life to lead, America
